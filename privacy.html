                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-thin">Cookies</h2>
                <p>When you access our website, information of a general nature is automatically collected using a cookie. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your Internet service provider and similar information. This is exclusively information which does not allow any conclusions about your person.</p>
                <p>This information is technically necessary in order to correctly deliver the contents of websites requested by you and is mandatory when using the Internet. It is processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="indent">Ensuring that the website can be connected without problems,</li>
                    <li class="indent">Ensuring a smooth use of our website,</li>
                    <li class="indent">Evaluation of system security and stability and for other administrative purposes.</li>
                    <li class="indent">The processing of your personal data is based on our legitimate interest from the aforementioned purposes for data collection. We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. The recipients of the data are only the responsible body and, if applicable, processors.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Like many other websites, we also use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that are transferred to your hard disk by a website server. This automatically provides us with certain data such as IP address, browser used, operating system and your connection to the Internet.</p>
                <p>Cookies cannot be used to start programs or transfer viruses to a computer. We can use the information contained in cookies to make navigation easier for you and to enable our web pages to be displayed correctly.</p>
                <p>Under no circumstances will the data we collect be passed on to third parties or linked to personal data without your consent.</p>
                <p>Of course, you can always view our website without cookies. Internet browsers are regularly set to accept cookies. In general, you can deactivate the use of cookies at any time via the settings of your browser. Please use the help functions of your Internet browser to find out how to change these settings. Please note that individual functions of our website may not work if you have deactivated the use of cookies.</p>
                <p>Anonymous information of this kind is statistically evaluated by us, if necessary, in order to optimize our Internet presence and the technology behind it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-thin">How we protect your information</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-thin">Deletion or blocking of data</h3>
                <p>We adhere to the principles of data avoidance and data economy. We therefore only store your personal data for as long as is necessary to achieve the purposes stated here or as required by the various storage periods provided for by law. After the respective purpose has ceased to exist or these periods have expired, the corresponding data is routinely blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
                <h3 class="heading-thin">SSL Encryption</h3>
                <p>To protect the security of your data during transmission, we use state-of-the-art encryption procedures (e.g., SSL) via HTTPS.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-thin">How we use the information you provide us</h2>
                <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our site and services, including:</p>

                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-thin">Use of Google Analytics</h2>
                <p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (following: Google). Google Analytics uses "cookies," which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server and stored there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. The IP address transmitted by your browser within the scope of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.</p>
                <p>The purposes of data processing are to evaluate the use of the website and to compile reports on activities on the website. Based on the use of the website and the internet, further associated services are then to be provided. The processing is based on the legitimate interest of the website operator.</p>
                <p>You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser software accordingly; however, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of this website to their full extent. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) to Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link:</p>
                <p><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" class="bg-light-link">Browser Add-On to deactivate Google Analytics</a></p>
                <p>In addition or as an alternative to the Browser Add-On, you can prevent tracking by Google Analytics on our pages by clicking on this link. This will install an opt-out cookie on your device. This prevents Google Analytics from tracking this website and this browser in the future as long as the cookie remains installed in your browser.</p>
                <br>
                <h2 class="heading-thin">Use of script libraries</h2>
                <h3 class="heading-thin">Google Web Fonts</h3>
                <p>In order to display our content correctly and graphically appealing across browsers, we use script libraries and font libraries such as <a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/" class="bg-light-link">Google Web Fonts</a> on this website. Google Web fonts are cached in your browser to avoid multiple loading. If your browser does not support Google Web Fonts or prevents access, content will be displayed in a default font.</p>
                <p>Calling up script libraries or font libraries automatically triggers a connection to the library operator. It is theoretically possible &mdash; although it is currently unclear whether and for what purposes &mdash; that the operators of such libraries collect data.</p>
                <p>The privacy policy of the library operator Google can be found here: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" class="bg-light-link">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></p>
                <h3 class="heading-thin">Font Awesome Icons</h3>
                <p>In order to provide supplementing visual aids across browsers, we use Fonticons' Font Awesome Icons scripts on this website. These scripts are cached in your browser to avoid multiple loading. If your browser does not support Font Awesome Icons or prevents access, content will not be displayed.</p>
                <p>The privacy policy of the library operator Fonticons can be found here: <a href="https://fontawesome.com/privacy" class="bg-light-link">https://fontawesome.com/privacy</a></p>
